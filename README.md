-- EXECUTABLE --
Executable doesnt't work right. Here the issues that don't happen when running the game in Unity:

 - The Main Menu audio won't play at first.
 - When playing the game for the first time, it jumps the Game Over screen. It's only the first time, after that everything works correctly.
